# DDR5 RDIMM Memory Heatsink

A DDR5 RDIMM Memory module heatsink design files.

The design files in this repo works for any DDR5 RDIMM memory modules which is common on workstations and servers.

There are many DDR5 (non-RDIMM) heatsinks from many brands, but they either don't fit on double sided modules, or they won't fit the PMIC.

You can send to any place which has CNC on aluminium or copper for manufacture. I did mines on PCBWay.com and they worked just fine.

Each heatsink have roles on top with the standard screws which should fit most of the watter blocks for RAM from many manufacturers.
